```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

```
```{r}
df <- data.frame(X1 = c(3,NA,2,4),
                 X2 = c(4,1,2,NA),
                 X3 = c(4,1,NA,3))
df
```


```{r}
cor(df, use=  "pairwise.complete.obs")
```


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
