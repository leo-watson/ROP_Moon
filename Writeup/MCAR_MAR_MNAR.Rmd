# MCAR
* We are in a MCAR missing data mechanism scenario when missingness is some constant that’s the same for all data points.  

* Mathematically: $P(R_i|Y_i)=P(R_i) = 𝜙$, where $Y_i$ is the i-th data point in our dataset $Y$, $R_i$ is an indicator for missingness ($R_i$ = 0 if not missing, $R_i = 1 if missing), $𝜙$ is some parameter of the missing data model.  

* Example: Each student’s mark is stored in a spreadsheet by the instructor but following a computer update 10% of the data is deleted at random.  


# MAR
*We are in a MAR scenario when missingness is dependent on some observed variable of the data. In this case, the probability of missingness is dependent on groups defined by the data.  

* Mathematically: $P(R_i|Y_i) = P(R_i|Y_{i,o})$   

*Example: Most students joined the class from day 1, but some students joined late from the waitlist due to capacity restrictions. 10% of students who joined on time had a missing submission for the first problem set, while 30% of students who joined late missed the first problem set.



# MNAR
* We are in a MNAR missing data mechanism scenario when the missingness is dependent on some reason unknown to us. In this case, probability of missingness is dependent on true value of data point.
*Mathematically: $P(R_i|Y_i)  P(R_i|Y_{i,o})$ [probability of missingness doesn’t depend on observe data; it depends on unobserved data!]
* Example: Due to a catastrophic system failure, the spreadsheet corrupts causing the instructor to lose all the students’ marks. Left with no choice, the instructor requests the students to calculate and share their true final marks to the instructor. If they don’t, the instructor will input that they got a B.
  + If a student’s true mark is an A, they are 90% likely to state their true mark. 
  + If a student’s true mark is a B, they are 70% likely to state their true mark.
  + If a student’s true mark is a C, they are 50% likely to state their true mark.
