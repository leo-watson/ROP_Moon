### Description
* Very similar to deterministic regression imputation but as an extra step adds noise to predictions to account for the uncertainty in imputation.


### Pros
* Unlike deterministic regression imputation, preserves correlation between variables.


### Cons
* Can lead to negative values [negative ozone, as shown LHS], which adds additional complexity b/c implausible.
* This model assumes equal dispersion of data for the entire linear model. Hence, not accurate for heteroscedastic (non-costant variance) distributions.
