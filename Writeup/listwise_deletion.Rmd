# Listwise Deletion (Complete-Case Analysis)

### Description
* Eliminates all observations containing ANY missing values in variables of interest.
* ![example from Excel](/Users/leo/Desktop/UofT/ROP/ROP_Moon/Writeup/Images/listwise_deletion.png)

### Pros
* Highly convenient and computationally cheap.
* Robust model due to studying purely complete-cases.
* Unbiased estimates of means, variances, and regression coefficients under MCAR missingness.
* Can be efficient and exceedingly effective in specific scenarios:
  +(1): If probability to be missing does not depend on Y (Response). Missing data rate may depend on any predictors X, with missing data in both Y/X.
  + (2): If complete data model is logistic regression. If missing data is confined to one of Y or X, regression coefficients are unbiased if missingness depends only on Y and not on X.



### Cons
* Wasteful, especially in cases where observations are only missing a small fraction of variable values. May be computationally cheap, but wasteful of expensive data.
* If data isnâ€™t MCAR, severely biased estimates of means, variances, and regression coefficients.
