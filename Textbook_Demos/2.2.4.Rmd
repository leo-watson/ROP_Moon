## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
# Definite logistic function [~ 2.2.4 Definition]
logistic <- function(x) exp(x) / (1 + exp(x))
set.seed(80122)
n <- 300
# 300 observations. STANDARD Bivariate normal => mu1 = mu2 = 0, rho1 = rho2 = 1, and correlation given as 0.5 [gives us Sigma matrix] 
y <- MASS::mvrnorm(n = n, mu = c(0, 0),
                   Sigma = matrix(c(1, 0.5, 0.5, 1), nrow = 2))
# Creating missing data models for each of MCAR, MAR, MNAR cases.
r2.mcar <- 1 - rbinom(n, 1, 0.5)
r2.mar  <- 1 - rbinom(n, 1, logistic(y[, 1]))
r2.mnar <- 1 - rbinom(n, 1, logistic(y[, 2]))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
