## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
# Installs "mice" package
install.packages("mice")
install.packages("tidyverse")
# Loads package
library("mice")
library(tidyverse)
# 
imp <- mice(airquality, method = "mean", m = 1, maxit = 1)
# Create dataframe with imputed data
imp1 = complete(imp)
# PLot imputed data [My attempt]
ggplot(data = imp1, aes(x=Ozone)) +
         geom_histogram()
    
imp1 %>% summarize(mean_ozone = mean(Ozone),
                   rho_ozone = sd(Ozone),
                   mean_Solar.R = mean(Solar.R),
                   rho_Solar.R = sd(Solar.R))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
