## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
airquality

```

```{r cars}
options(na.action = na.omit)
fit <- lm(Ozone ~ Wind, data = airquality)
head(na.action(fit))
# airquality2 <- cbind(airquality, predict(fit))
naprint(na.action(fit))
airquality2 <- cbind(na.omit(airquality[, c("Ozone", "Wind")]),
                     predicted = predict(fit))
# Trying to recreate Figure 1.1
airquality2 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Ozone, y= predicted)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(x = "Ozone measured (ppb)",
       y = "Ozone predicted") +
  geom_smooth(method="lm", se=FALSE)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
