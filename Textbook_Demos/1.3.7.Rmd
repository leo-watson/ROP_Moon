## R MarkdownS

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library("mice")
library(tidyverse)
# Replaces missing data with mean for each variable in airquality
imp <- mice(airquality, method = "mean", m = 1,
            maxit = 1, print = FALSE)
# Create tibble with mean imputed tibble adjoined with Boolean for missingness
airquality2 <- cbind(complete(imp),
                     r.Ozone = is.na(airquality[, "Ozone"]))
# Apply lin reg with two vars [one numerical, one categorical] to predict Wind
fit <- lm(Wind ~ Ozone + r.Ozone, data = airquality2)
summary(fit)$coefficients
# Create plot
airquality2 %>% ggplot(aes(x=Ozone, y = Wind, color = r.Ozone)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se= FALSE) + 
  labs(x= "Ozone (ppb)", y = "Wind (mph)")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
head(airquality)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
