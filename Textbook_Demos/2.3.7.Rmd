## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(mice)
# Apply multiple imputations with 10 datasets to nhanes dataset
imp <- mice(nhanes, print = FALSE, m = 10, seed = 24415)
complete(imp)
# fit lin reg
fit <- with(imp, lm(bmi ~ age))
est <- pool(fit)
est
# 2.4.3:
summary(est, conf.int = TRUE)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
