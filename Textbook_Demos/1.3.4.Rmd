## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
# Fit linear regression to Ozone w.r.t Solar.R
fit <- lm(Ozone ~ Solar.R, data = airquality)
fit
# Applies fit to the incomplete "ic" cases of airquality.
pred <- predict(fit, newdata = ic(airquality))
pred
typeof(pred)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
install.packages("mice")
# Loads package
library("mice")
library(tidyverse)

# Create tibble w/ 2 column vectors.
data <- airquality[, c("Ozone", "Solar.R")]
# Applies regression imputation to Ozone w.r.t Solar.R
imp <- mice(data, method = "norm.predict", seed = 1,
           m = 1, print = FALSE)
complete(imp)
xyplot(imp, Ozone ~ Solar.R)

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
