## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
# Loads package
library("mice")
library(tidyverse)

# Apply LOCF to Ozone variable
airquality2 <- tidyr::fill(airquality, Ozone)
# See StackOverflow post. MUST use data = ... 
xyplot(data = airquality2, Ozone ~ Day)
ozone_filled <- airquality2 %>% select(Ozone)
ozone_original <- airquality %>% select(Ozone)
# Compare LOCF applied VS original Ozone observations
compared <- cbind(ozone_filled, ozone_original)
compared



data <- airquality[, c("Ozone", "Solar.R")]
# Applies regression imputation to Ozone w.r.t Solar.R
imp <- mice(data, method = "norm.predict", seed = 1,
           m = 1, print = FALSE)
xyplot(imp, Ozone ~ Solar.R)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
