## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
install.packages("lavaan", dependencies = TRUE)
library(lavaan)
fit <- lavaan("Ozone ~ 1 + Wind + Solar.R
              Ozone ~~ Ozone",
             sample.mean = mu, sample.cov = cv,
             sample.nobs = sum(complete.cases(data)))
fit
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
