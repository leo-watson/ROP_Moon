## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
# Multiple Imputation Case
library("mice")
# Apply multiple imputation to airquality to create m = 20 datasets 
imp <- mice(airquality, seed = 1, m = 20, print = FALSE)
# Fits linear regression model to predict Ozone using Wind, Temp, Solar.R as explanatory vars
fit <- with(imp, lm(Ozone ~ Wind + Temp + Solar.R))
# pools the twenty datasets' estimated parameters [B_0, B_1, B_2, B_3]
summary(pool(fit))

# Complete Data Case [i.e. Listwise Deletion] 
options(na.action = na.omit)
fit <- lm(Ozone ~ Wind + Temp + Solar.R, data = airquality)
coef(summary(fit))


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
